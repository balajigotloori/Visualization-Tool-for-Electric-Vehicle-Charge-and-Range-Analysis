# Visualization-Tool-for-Electric-Vehicle-Charge-and-Range-Analysis

## 🚗 Project Overview

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are reshaping global transportation. This project uses **Tableau** to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes data on EV models, specifications, and charging infrastructure across **India and globally**. The goal is to help **EV buyers** and **policy analysts** explore insights and make informed decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Analysing different data from multiple sources for Electric cars in India and globally.**  
We worked with four distinct datasets that include EV specifications, pricing, efficiency, and charging infrastructure. The data is cleaned, connected via MySQL, and visualized using Tableau Dashboards and Stories to provide meaningful insights for decision-making.
